    question:
      "Why do I have to pay for my refuse to be collected when I’m already paying business rates?",
    answer:
      "We collect business rates on behalf of central government. Business rates vary according to the rateable value of the premises occupied. Different types of business could occupy the same amount of space but produce very different amounts or types of waste, so a standard commercial waste rate wouldn’t be fair.",

    question:
      "My business doesn’t produce much waste. What’s the minimum contract?",

      "The minimum contract for a bin collection is once a fortnight. But you can buy commercial waste and recycling sacks, and we’ll collect them on a designated day. You don’t need a contract for this service. The cost of the sacks includes supply, collection and disposal. But there is a delivery charge if you are unable to collect the sacks from our offices in Southcote Road.  ",

    question: "Can I arrange for you to visit outside of normal office hours?",
